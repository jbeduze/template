    Here are the basics to creating a mean looking streamlit app, no longer are you restricted to boring UIs, because regardless of how well it works, pretty things are more appealing to the audience, so let's make them drop dead gorgeous!!

    This repo will serve as a template for what you can do, and I'll try and put as many notes as possible for every component I have in here too!

    Commenting out
</div>

---

Python code commenting out:
---
* You only have to put a hashtag (#) in front of the string you want commented out

         #Commented out item

* to comment out multiple lines of code at once use:  ctrl + /
    
        (highlight the line's content)

        #multiple lines hashed out 1
        #multiple lines hashed out 1
        #multiple lines hashed out 1

CSS code commenting out:
---
* You have to surround the commented out string with /*str*/ to comment out items

        /*  */
        /*commented out item*/

    Docstrings within functions
</div>

---
Creating "docstrings" or descriptions of use in python

* this can include the functions purpose, parameters and output
example:
        
        def new_function():
            """
            This function prints a message indicating that it is a new function.
            """
        print("This is a new function")

    #Calling the function to see the output

        new_function()
     
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; color: red">
    Images: (creation, import to another page, and hover)

    Custom fonts
</div>

Google has your back! If you want some super fun fonts, Google has simplified the process and it is super easy to cover your web app in amazing fonts, elevating your app to new heights adding that extra bit of flare!

1. search google fonts and you should land on **fonts.google.com**
2. scroll around and select one or multiple fonts that you want!

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 14px;color: red">
    Image: multiple selected fonts
</div>

3. When you are satified with all the fonts you've selected, hit the **get the embed code** option
4. then grab the @import link and pop it into a style.css file

<div style="text-align: left; font-size: 14px;color: red">
    Image: import page
</div>

5. Within a style.css file, you can put the link into this code

        @import url('link here')

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;color: red">
    Save Space: only import one link, only one will work so make sure you get all the fonts in that single link!!!
</div>
